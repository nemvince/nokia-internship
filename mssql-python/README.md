# mssql-python

## Overview

`mssql-python` is a Python-based data analysis project focused on extracting, analyzing, and visualizing business data, likely from a Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) database. The project provides insights into customer behavior, product performance, sales trends, and seasonal patterns through various analyses and visualizations.

## Core Functionality

- **Data Extraction:** Connects to a database (presumably MSSQL) to retrieve relevant business data.
- **Data Analysis:** Processes and analyzes the data to uncover trends and insights.
- **Visualization:** Generates visual outputs (PNG images) to represent the results of the analyses.

## Main Script

### `main.py`

This is the primary script of the project. It likely contains functions for:

- Connecting to the database
- Querying and processing data
- Performing analyses such as:
  - Customer analysis
  - Product analysis
  - Sales performance analysis
  - Seasonal trend analysis
- Generating and saving visualizations as PNG files

#### Example Functions (inferred):

- `connect_to_database()`: Establishes a connection to the MSSQL database.
- `analyze_customers()`: Analyzes customer data and saves results to `customer_analysis.png`.
- `analyze_products()`: Analyzes product data and saves results to `product_analysis.png`.
- `analyze_sales_performance()`: Evaluates sales performance and saves results to `sales_performance.png`.
- `analyze_seasonality()`: Examines seasonal trends and saves results to `seasonal_analysis.png`.

## Outputs

The project generates the following output files:

- `customer_analysis.png`: Visualization of customer-related insights.
- `product_analysis.png`: Visualization of product performance.
- `sales_performance.png`: Visualization of sales trends and performance.
- `seasonal_analysis.png`: Visualization of seasonal patterns in the data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages

### Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies

### Usage

Run the main script:

```powershell
python main.py
```

This will execute the analyses and generate the output PNG files in the project directory.

## Configuration

- **Database Connection:** Update the database connection details in `main.py` as needed for your environment.

## Environment Management

- The project includes a `mise.toml` file for environment management. Use [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) to set up the environment if desired.
